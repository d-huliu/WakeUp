#WakeUp.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
###Have your friends Motivate you to Wake Up... Try WakeUp Now!
A Social Media platform where your Alarm will not go off until you snap your friends with a morning task!

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## 💭Inspiration💭

With each new generation of students, it appears we are becoming worser at productivity, time management, and getting our day started. Let's not even bash GenZ yet; we (the developers) struggle to wake up to class (occasionally).

There is no better way to solve modern problems, than to introduce modern solutions: Social Media.
You wanna catch up with your friends? How about we try waking up first yea?

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## 🤔What it does🤔

###Never sleep through an alarm ever again. 
###Instead, wake up so you can snap your friends!

Wakeup forces you to wakeup by running an alarm until you complete the snap, given your defined prompt. **Eg: prompt is "Pic with Dog", then Alarm will run until you snap a photo with your dog.**
The Camera AI is backed by GPT4o to ensure your snap contains the correct activity. 

View what your friend's morning routines consist of in the **Feed** home tab. You will see when they wake up, what they posted, and their caption for the day.

Customize your morning routine under your **Profile**, where you can edit your Alarm and decide if you would like to manually choose your morning task or complete the automatically generated ones with your friends!

Create your own WakeUp Account to then find/add your friends in the **Chat** tab. Message your friends about their tasks, and potentially organized shared morning routines that you can all stick to!

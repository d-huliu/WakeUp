## 💭Inspiration💭

With each new generation of students, it appears we are becoming worser at productivity, time management, and getting our day started. Let's not even bash GenZ yet; we (the developers) struggle to wake up to class (occasionally).

There is no better way to solve modern problems, than to introduce modern solutions: Social Media.
You wanna catch up with your friends? How about we try waking up first yea?

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## 🤔What it does🤔

###Never sleep through an alarm ever again. 
###Instead, wake up so you can snap your friends!

Wakeup forces you to wakeup by running an alarm until you complete the snap, given your defined prompt. **Eg: prompt is "Pic with Dog", then Alarm will run until you snap a photo with your dog.**
The Camera AI is backed by GPT4o to ensure your snap contains the correct activity. 

View what your friend's morning routines consist of in the **Feed** home tab. You will see when they wake up, what they posted, and their caption for the day.

Customize your morning routine under your **Profile**, where you can edit your Alarm and decide if you would like to manually choose your morning task or complete the automatically generated ones with your friends!

Create your own WakeUp Account to then find/add your friends in the **Chat** tab. Message your friends about their tasks, and potentially organized shared morning routines that you can all stick to!

## 🔨How we built it🔨
We built WakeUp using a modern tech stack centered around React for the frontend, utilizing Chakra UI for a responsive and visually appealing user interface. Firebase was integrated for real-time database interactions and authentication, ensuring seamless data storage and retrieval for user profiles, friends, and chat messages. 

The project employs React Router for navigation between the various components, such as the alarm system, profile management, and chat interface. Framer Motion and GSAP were used to add interactive animations, enhancing the user experience. We also incorporated react-webcam for snapshot functionality within the alarm feature, and UUID for unique user identification. T

he app's backend logic, including tasks, alarm management, and chat functionalities, was tied together using Firebase's real-time database and cloud storage, making the app both fully functional and scalable.

## 💪Challenges we ran into💪

- Firebase API led to an endpoint that didn't exist when trying to keep profile picture data
- Loading Chat and managing backend apps proved to be difficult

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## 🏆Accomplishments that we're proud of🏆
